# ChannelChat

This project is a real-time chat application which allows users to collaborate in a group or via direct messages. They can also streamline their work by making various channels regarding different aspects of their project. For example, a web development project has front-end, back-end as well as database connectivity. Communicating about all the aspects over a single group chat creates confusion among teams, hence this channelisation of messages helps them to work efficiently.
